# Car Sharing


## How to run

* Clone repository
* Get node modules by using (npm install) in root folder
* Install MongoDB Version 5.0.9 from https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community
* Run MongoDB on mongodb://localhost:27017
* (Create CarSharing Database necessary???)
* OPTIONAL: The data folder contains a cars.json file with 1000 example cars, this file can be imported into the database into the collection named "cars"
* Run `code(npm run server)` or code(node script/server.js) in root folder
    * The console should now display code(Server running on http://localhost:3000) and (MongoDB connected)
* Go to code(http://localhost:3000/) in any browser (tested in Firefox)

## Unit tests
* To run unit tests use code(npm test) in root folder
